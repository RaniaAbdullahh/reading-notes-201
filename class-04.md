# Links
Links are created using the (a) element. Users can click on anything between the opening (a) tag and the closing (/a) tag. You specify which page you want to link to using the href attribute
Links are created using the (a) element.

> The (a) element uses the href attribute to indicate the page you are linking to.

> If you are linking to a page within your own site, it is best to use relative links rather than qualified URLs.

> You can create links to open email programs with an email address in the "to" field.

> You can use the id attribute to target elements within a page that can be linked to.

# Layout
- Building Blocks

CSS treats each HTML element as if it is in its own box. This box will either be a block-level box or an inline box.
- Screen Sizes

Different visitors to your site will have different sized screens that show different amounts of information, so your design needs to be able to work on a range of different sized screens
- Screen Resolution

Resolution refers to the number of dots a screen shows per inch. Some devices have a higher resolution than desktop computers and most operating systems allow users to adjust the resolution of their screens.
- Page Sizes

Because screen sizes and display resolutions vary so much, web designers often try to create pages of around 960-1000 pixels wide
(since most users will be able to see designs this wide on their screens)

- Fixed Width Layouts
Fixed width layout designs do not change size as the user increases or decreases the size of their browser window. Measurements tend to be given in pixels.

- Liquid Layouts
Liquid layout designs stretch and contract as the user increases or decreases the size of their browser window. They tend to use percentages.

>Pages can be fixed width or liquid (stretchy) layouts.

> Designers keep pages within 960-1000 pixels wide, and indicate what the site is about within the top 600 pixels (to demonstrate its relevance without scrolling).

> Grids help create professional and flexible designs.

> CSS Frameworks provide rules for common tasks.

> You can include multiple CSS files in one page.

# FUNCTIONS
Functions let you group a series of statements together to perform a specific task. If different parts of a script repeat the same task, you can
reuse the function (rather than repeating the same set of statements). 

## FUNCTION EXPRESSIONS 
Expressions produce a value. They can be used where values are expected. If a function is placed where a browser expects to see an expression,
(e.g., as an argument to a function), then it gets treated as an expression.

## VARIABLE SCOPE 
The location where you declare a variable will affect where it can be used within your code. If you declare it within a function, it can only be used
within that function. This is known as the variable's scope. 
## HOW MEMORY & VARIABLES WORK:
Global variables use more memory. The browser has to remember them for as long as the web page using them is loaded. Local variables are only
remembered during the period of time that a function is being executed.

# 6 Reasons for Pair Programming
1. Greater efficiency
It is a common misconception that pair programming takes a lot longer and is less efficient. In reality, when two people focus on the same code base, it is easier to catch mistakes in the making.
Research indicates that pair programing takes slightly longer, but produces higher-quality code that doesnâ€™t require later effort in troubleshooting and debugging (let alone exposing users to a broken product).

2. Engaged collaboration
When two programmers focus on the same code, the experience is more engaging and both programmers are more focused than if they were working alone.

3. Learning from fellow students
Everyone has a different approach to problem solving; working with a teammate can expose developers to techniques they otherwise would not have thought of.

4. Social skills
Pair programming is great for improving social skills. When working with someone who has a different coding style, communication is key. This can become more difficult when two programmers have different personalities.

5. Job interview readiness
A common step in many interview processes involves pair programming between a current employee and an applicant, either in person or through a shared screen.

6. Work environment readiness
Many companies that utilize pair programing expect to train fresh hires from CS-degree programs on how they operate to actually deliver a product. Code Fellows graduates who are already familiar with how pairing works can hit the ground running at a new job,
with one less hurdle to overcome.
