# CSS
make your web pages more attractive, controlling the design of them using CSS.

> CSS rule contains two parts: a selector and a declaration. p{font-size:50px}

- selector
 indicate which element the rule applies to. 

-  declarations
made up of two parts: a property and a value. h1{color;green}

* CSS rules usually appear in a separate document, although they may appear within an HTML page.

# JAVA SCRIPT INSTRUCTIONS 
 with JS you can give a web browser instructions you want it to follow. 
 - VAR : to declare variables  var quantity = 6;
 JavaScript distinguishes between numbers (0-9), strings (text), and Boolean values (true or false).
 
 - Expressions evaluate into a single value.
 - Expressions rely on operators to calculate a value.

>else :to specify a block of code to be executed, if the same condition is false

>else if : to specify a new condition to test, if the first condition is false
