# Images
- Choosing Images for Your Site
A picture can say a thousand words, and great images help make the difference between an average-looking site and a really engaging one.
- Storing Images on Your Site:
If you are building a site from scratch, it is good practice to create a folder for all of the images the site uses.

## Adding Images 
- we use 3 elements:
1. src
2. alt
3. title

>Image Dimensions :

>The images you use on your website should be saved at the same width and height that you
want them to appear on the page.

## Animated GIFs:
Animated GIFs show several frames of animage in sequence and therefore can be used to
create simple animations.

>u should save images at the size you will be using them on the web page and in the appropriate format.

>Photographs are best saved as JPEGs; illustrations or logos that use flat colors are better saved as GIFs.

# Colors
1- rgb values                                
These express colors in terms
of how much red, green and
blue are used to make it up. For
example: rgb(100,100,90         
sign. For example: #ee3e80

2-  hex codes
These are six-digit codes that
represent the amount of red,
green and blue in a color,
preceded by a pound or hash # sign. For example: #ee3e80

3- color names
There are 147 predefined color
names that are recognized
by browsers. For example:
DarkCyan

>Every color on a computer screen is created by mixing amounts of red,
green, and blue. To find the color you want, you can use a color picker.

## Contrast
When picking foreground and background colors, it is important to ensure that there is
enough contrast for the text to be legible.

Color pickers can help you find the color you want.
> It is important to ensure that there is enough contrast between any text and the background color (otherwise
people will not be able to read your content).

> CSS3 has introduced an extra value for RGB colors to indicate opacity. It is known as RGBA.

> CSS3 also allows you to specify colors as HSL values, with an optional opacity value. It is known as HSLA.

# Text

## Typeface Terminology
1. Serif :In print, serif fonts were traditionally used for long passages of text because they were considered easier to read
2. Sans-Serif : Screens have a lower resolution than print. So, if the text is small, sans-serif fonts can be clearer to read.
3. Monospace : Monospace fonts are commonly used for code because they align nicely, making the text easier to follow

## Type Scales
You may have noticed that programs such as Word, Photoshop and InDesign offer the same sizes of text.

h1     body
h2     18px
h3     14px

* If you want to use a wider range of typefaces there are several options, but you need to have the right license
  to use them.
* You can control the space between lines of text, individual letters, and words. Text can also be aligned
  to the left, right, center, or justified. It can also be indented.
* You can use pseudo-classes to change the style of an element when a user hovers over or clicks on text, or
  when they have visited a link
