## Lists on HTML.

There are three types of HTML lists:

1. ordered :  each item in the list is numbered (ol)
2. unordered : each item in the list begin with a bullet point (ul)
3. definition :  made up of a set of terms along with the definitions for each of those terms. (d1,dd,dt)

-  Definition lists are used to define terminology.
-  Lists can be nested inside one another.
Browsers display nested lists indented further than the parent list.
In nested unordered lists, the browser will usually change the style of the bullet point too.

#  Boxes

Every box has three properties to control its appearance:
- Border
- Margin
- Padding

> The padding and margin properties are very helpful in adding space between various items on the page.

** border-width**
it can be thin, medium and thick.
you can control it in more detailes:
- border-top-width
- border-right-width
- border-bottom-width
- border-left-width
or one time : border-width: 2px 1px 1px 2px;

** It is possible to hide elements using the display and visibility properties.**
** Block-level boxes can be made into inline boxes, and inline boxes made into block-level boxes.**
** Legibility can be improved by controlling the width of boxes containing text and the leading.**
** CSS3 has introduced the ability to create image borders and rounded borders.**

# JQUERY
jQuery doesn't do anything you cannot achieve with pure JavaScript. It is just a JavaScript file but estimates show it has been used on over 
a quarter of the sites on the web, because it makes coding simpler. 

FINDING ELEMENTS 
Using jQuery, you usually select elements using CSS-style selectors

DOING THINGS WITH YOUR SELECTION
- CONTENT FILTERS
- FINDING ELEMENTS 

LOOPING 
n plain JavaScript, if you wanted to do the same thing to several elements, you would need to
write code to loop through all of the elements you selected. 

CHAINING 
If you want to use more than one jQuery method on the same selection of elements, you can list several methods at a time
using dot notation to separate each one.

GETTING ELEMENT CONTENT 
The • htm 1 () and • text () methods both retrieve and update the content of elements.

EVENT METHODS 
The • on () method is used to handle all events. Behind the scenes, jQuery handles all of the cross-browser issues you saw in the last chapter. 

THE EVENT OBJECT 
Every event handling function receives an event object. It has methods and properties related to the event that occurred.
