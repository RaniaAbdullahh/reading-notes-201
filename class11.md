> You can specify the dimensions of images using CSS. This is very helpful when you use the same sized images on several pages of your site. 

> Images can be aligned both horizontally and vertically using CSS.

> You can use a background image behind the box created by any element on a page.

> Background images can appear just once or be repeated across the background of the box.

## Practical Information
### Search Engine Optimization (SEO)
improve your website's visibility on search engines.
At the heart of SEO is the idea of working out which terms people are likely to enter into a search engine to find your site and then
using these terms in the right places on your site to increase the chances that search engines will show a link.
- On-Page Techniques
The main component of this is looking at keywords that people are likely to enter into a search engine if they wanted to findyour site, and then including
these in the text and HTML code for your site in order to help the search engines know that your site covers these topics.
- Off-Page Techniques
They are particularly interested in sites whose content is related to yours. For example, if you were running a website that
sold fish bait, then a link from a hairdresser is not likely to be considered as relevant as one from an angling community.

* Search engine optimization helps visitors find your sites when using search engines.
 Analytics tools such as Google Analytics allow you to see how many people visit your site, how they find it, and what they do when they get there.
* To put your site on the web, you will need to obtain a domain name and web hosting.
* FTP programs allow you to transfer files from your local computer to your web server.
* Many companies provide platforms for blogging, email newsletters, e-commerce and other popular website tools (to save you writing them from scratch).
